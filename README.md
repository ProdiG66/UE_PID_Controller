# Unreal Engine PID Controller (C++)

## Overview

This project provides a simple and versatile Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller implementation for Unreal Engine. PID controllers are widely used in control systems to maintain or achieve a desired setpoint by adjusting the system's output. This Unreal Engine-specific PID controller can be easily integrated into your UE projects to achieve precise and stable control in various applications.

## Features

- **Easy Integration:** The PID controller is designed to be easily integrated into your UE projects, allowing for seamless use in a variety of scenarios.
- **Customizable Parameters:** The controller comes with customizable PID parameters (Proportional, Integral, Derivative gains) to fine-tune the performance based on your specific requirements.
- **Versatility:** Suitable for a wide range of applications, such as robot control, camera stabilization, and other scenarios where precise and dynamic control is necessary.

## Getting Started

To use the PID Controller:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ProdiG66/UE_PID_Controller.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Unreal Engine 5.3

3. Explore the various features, mechanics, and demo VFX.

4. Modify and extend the project to suit your needs.
